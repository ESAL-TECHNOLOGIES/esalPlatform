# Next.js to Vite Migration Report

## Overview

This document summarizes the migration of the ESAL Platform frontend applications from Next.js to Vite-based React applications. The migration was completed successfully for both the main web application and the documentation site.

## Migration Scope

1. **Main Web Application**:
   - Converted from Next.js app directory structure to a Vite React application
   - Replaced file-based routing with React Router
   - Migrated from server-side authentication to client-side with Supabase Auth
   - Updated all environment variables from `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` to `VITE_*`
   - Implemented proper component structure with AuthContext and protected routes

2. **Documentation Site**:
   - Converted from Next.js app directory structure to a Vite React application
   - Migrated static assets and styling
   - Preserved the original design and functionality
   - Added proper font handling and theme support

## Benefits of Migration

1. **Improved Development Experience**:
   - Faster build and reload times with Vite's HMR
   - Simpler configuration and dependency management
   - Reduced complexity by eliminating server-side rendering concerns

2. **Better Performance**:
   - Smaller bundle sizes
   - Optimized client-side rendering
   - Improved developer productivity with faster feedback cycles

3. **Simplified Architecture**:
   - More straightforward client-side routing
   - Clearer separation of concerns
   - Easier authentication flow

## Technical Details

1. **Components and Structure**:
   - Created dedicated context providers for authentication and app state
   - Implemented React Router with proper route protection
   - Organized code into logical directories (components, context, routes, services)

2. **Styling**:
   - Retained Tailwind CSS configuration
   - Migrated CSS modules to standard CSS imports
   - Preserved dark/light mode functionality

3. **Build Configuration**:
   - Updated Turborepo configuration to remove Next.js-specific settings
   - Configured proper build outputs for Vite projects
   - Set up consistent environment variable handling

## Future Recommendations

1. Consider adding more comprehensive tests for the Vite-based applications
2. Update documentation to reflect the new architecture and setup process
3. Explore additional Vite optimizations for production builds

## Conclusion

The migration from Next.js to Vite was successful, resulting in more maintainable and faster applications. Both the web application and documentation site now use a more straightforward React architecture with improved developer experience and performance.
