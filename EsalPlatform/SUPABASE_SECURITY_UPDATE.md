# 🔐 Supabase Security Configuration Update

## ✅ Security Enhancement Completed
**Date**: May 29, 2025

### 🎯 Objective
Ensure that only the Supabase anonymous key is used in the implementation, removing any references to the service role key for enhanced security.

### ✅ Changes Made

#### 1. **Configuration Cleanup** (`config.py`)
- ✅ Removed `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` from Settings class
- ✅ Added security comment explaining the anonymous-key-only approach
- ✅ Verified no compilation errors

#### 2. **Environment Files Updated**
- ✅ Removed service role key from `.env.example`
- ✅ Removed service role key from `.env.schema`
- ✅ Updated `DEVELOPMENT_STATUS.md` documentation

#### 3. **Documentation Updates**
- ✅ Updated `README.md` to remove service role key references
- ✅ Cleaned up deployment documentation
- ✅ Updated environment variable examples

### 🛡️ Security Benefits

1. **Reduced Attack Surface**: No sensitive service role key exposed in configuration
2. **Principle of Least Privilege**: Using only the anonymous key for client operations
3. **Best Practices**: Following Supabase security recommendations for client-side applications

### ✅ Verification

- ✅ **No service role key usage found** in any Python code
- ✅ **Authentication service correctly uses** only `settings.SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
- ✅ **All configuration files cleaned** of service role key references
- ✅ **Documentation updated** to reflect security improvements

### 🔍 Current Supabase Implementation

The authentication service (`app/services/auth.py`) correctly initializes the Supabase client with:

```python
self.supabase: Client = create_client(
    settings.SUPABASE_URL,
    settings.SUPABASE_ANON_KEY  # ✅ Only anonymous key used
)
```

### 🚀 Next Steps

- The platform now follows security best practices for Supabase integration
- All user authentication and operations use the anonymous key with proper RLS policies
- No administrative or elevated privileges are exposed in the client configuration

**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED** - Supabase implementation now uses only the anonymous key as requested.
