-- STORAGE POLICIES SETUP
-- ========================================
-- Run this script in your Supabase SQL Editor after creating the storage buckets
-- This sets up secure access policies for idea-files and avatars buckets

-- ========================================
-- CLEAN UP EXISTING STORAGE POLICIES
-- ========================================

-- Remove any existing policies to avoid conflicts
