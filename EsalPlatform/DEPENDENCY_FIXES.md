# ESAL Platform Dependency Fixes

## Overview

During the refactoring of the ESAL Platform to a simplified MVP, several dependency issues were identified and fixed. This document outlines those issues and their solutions for future reference.

## Icon Library Dependencies

### Issue
After refactoring, the web-vite application showed errors related to missing icon libraries:

1. `lucide-react`: Used in multiple components including:
   - `ProtectedRoute.tsx`
   - `Layout.tsx`
   - `ErrorBoundary.tsx`
   - `LoadingSpinner.tsx`

2. `@heroicons/react`: Used in several pages including:
   - `Settings.tsx`
   - `Profile.tsx`
   - `PitchBuilder.tsx`
   - `MatchMaking.tsx`
   - `AIServices.tsx`

### Solution
Both icon libraries were added as dependencies to the web-vite application:

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "@heroicons/react": "^2.1.1",
    "lucide-react": "^0.323.0",
    // other dependencies
  }
}
```

### Implementation Steps
1. Identified components using icon libraries via code search
2. Added the missing dependencies to package.json
3. Ran `pnpm install` to install the dependencies
4. Verified that the application could start without import errors

## Authentication Context Updates

### Issue
The refactoring required simplified authentication, moving from a complex role-based system to a streamlined approach. This required updating components that relied on the old authentication context.

### Solution
The `ProtectedRoute` component was updated to use the new AuthContext approach:

- Changed from using `isAuthenticated` and `isLoading` to `user` and `loading`
- Updated the `RoleProtectedRoute` component to use the simplified auth context
- Ensured proper user profile type handling for nullable values

### Implementation Steps
1. Updated the `AuthContext.tsx` to provide the simplified authentication context
2. Modified the `ProtectedRoute.tsx` components to use the new context properties
3. Updated the `App.tsx` router to use the local AuthContext instead of the shared package

## Future Considerations

When adding new features or components to the ESAL Platform MVP, keep these dependencies in mind:

1. For icons, use either:
   - `lucide-react` (preferred for new components)
   - `@heroicons/react` (for maintaining consistency with existing pages)

2. For authentication, use the local `AuthContext` defined in `src/context/AuthContext.tsx`

3. For new pages requiring protected routes, use the `ProtectedRoute` component which handles authentication checks
